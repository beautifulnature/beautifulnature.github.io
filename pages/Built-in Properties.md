description:: There are built-in properties that control Logseq functionality. Most of these properties are hidden from the user but a few are user editable. These property names are reserved for Logseq and thus _must_ not be used as a user property.

- Legend for properties below:
	- (1) and (N) indicate how many values you may define, one and multiple values respectively.
	- (page) and (block) indicates a property is a page property or block property only. Otherwise a property can be both a page property and block property.
- Editable properties
	- `icon` (1) (page) - define icon identifier for a page.
	- `title` (1) (page) - overrides the title of a page to be different from the file name.
	- `tags` (N) - get listed in their own section "Pages tagged with X" below a page.
	- `template` (1) - designates a page/block as a template.
	- `template-including-parent` (1) - specifies whether the parent level content of the selected block should be included when using a template. previously called `include-parent`
	- `alias` (N) - define synonyms for a page.
	- `filters` (N) (page) - store selected filters for linked references on page level. object with booleans.
