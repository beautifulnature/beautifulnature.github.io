- #+BEGIN_TIP
  * Clicking a backlink will open the linked page in the main window.
  * Shift + clicking a backlink will open the linked page in the sidebar.
  * Opening a backlink to a page which does not currently exist will create a new page with the backlink text as its title.
  * The [[Unlinked References]] list located below [[Linked References]] on a page displays potential backlinks, files which refer to the page but do not have a relevant backlink present.
